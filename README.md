# Poisson Regression Model
We already know about the Linear Regression, which helps us answer questions like "How much will a house with these characteristics cost?". Or the the Logistic Regression, which is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.

But, what happens when the questions are "How many costumers will come today?", "How many personas are in line at the grocery store?", "How **many**...?", and one way to answer these questions is using the Poisson Regression Model.

Poisson Regression is used to model count data. For this, we assume the response variable Y has a Poisson Distribution, and assumes the logarithm of its expected value can be modeled by a linear combinations of unknown parameters.

## In this notebook
You'll find in this notebook a simple implementation for the Poisson Regression, along with a little example with generated data :sparkles:

Curious about the Poisson Regression? I got you! You can fin the full explanation on my [blog](https://ximenasandoval.github.io/2020/10/31/poisson.html)

By the way, thanks for passing by :sparkles: :two_hearts:
